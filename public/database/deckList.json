Key components to this deck are effects from its central angelic figures: each new Angel gets +1/1 per each existing Angel (Giada), plays a Land, or casts a Mana 3 or lower permanent from the grave that adds 2 Life when it’s sent to the grave (Serra Paragon), and returning a destroyed non-token creature to the player’s hand in the next end step (Liesa).\nThe latter’s bonus of enemy creatures being exiled upon death makes Liesa a particularly dangerous card to possess. However, on top of predictable Life gains (Lunarch Veteran, Inspiring Overseer), the deck’s other spells can also exile (Borrowed Time), and destroy (Go for the Throat, Sheoldred’s Edict, Stroke of Midnight, Touch the Spirit Realm) cards.",
