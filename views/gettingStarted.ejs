		<h3>Getting Started</h3>
		<p>Welcome to the exciting world of Magic: The Gathering! Whether you're a newcomer to the game or a seasoned gamer looking to learn a new hobby, this guide will help you take your first steps into the multiverse of Magic.</p>
		<p>This guide hopes to provide you with enough information to get you started playing your first game. I also hope that it can be a reference for you as you get to know the game.</p>
		<p>I separated the game into several key parts that break down the beefy game into manageable, bite-sized chunks that are easier to understand and quick to remember.</p>
